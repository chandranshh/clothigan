```The testing vercel link won't work past login page as I have not yet deployed the backend.```

MERN eCommerce Website using Redux Toolkit with Persist Redux

So I made this no so complete MERN E-commerce website which is quite dynamic and functional. I implemented Redux toolkit with persist storage to save the items in the cart so the user dont need to re-add the products in their cart again and again.

```Please note that this project is still a work in progress and several features are missing or incomplete. However, it serves as a good starting point and can be further developed to meet specific requirements.```

Missing features :
- no login/register auth to prevent unauthorised access to the site.
- side bar functionality is still missing.
- mens, womens and kids page is missing

To-Do List:
- CONNECT MONGODB TO THE FRONTEND (the site still relies on a fake store api to fetch data and doesnt support CURD operations)
- add an admin panel to perform CURD operations for product management.
- add a middleware auth using jwt token to prevent unauthorised access to admin panel.
- will have to work on the styling part of the site
- ...much more
